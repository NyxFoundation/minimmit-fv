/-- **Abstract per-processor state-transition interface for Algorithm 1**
    (Barrier 3, MVP: the protocol mechanics are modeled as an interface, not
    implemented operationally). Bundles the block/message encodings and the
    per-processor local state that the voting discipline ranges over. A concrete
    operational model can later *construct* a `StateView` without changing any
    theorem statement. -/

  /-- The view processor `p`'s local state is in at time `t`. -/

  /-- `p`'s local variable `notarised` at time `t`; `none` is the default `⊥`
      ("`⊥` is a default value, different than any block"), to which the
      variable is initialized and reset upon entering any view (lines 17, 21). -/

/-- **Voting discipline of Algorithm 1** for correct processors, as
    per-processor state-transition hypotheses (provable in any concrete
    operational model):

    * `vote_view` — a vote is cast for a block of the current view;
    * `vote_guard` — a vote is only cast while `notarised = ⊥` (lines 10, 20);
    * `vote_sets` — upon voting for `b`, `p` either sets `notarised := b`
      (line 11) and does not redefine it before entering the next view, or
      immediately enters the next view (lines 20–21) — and views only ever
      increase, so a left view is never re-entered. Both branches give: at any
      strictly later time still in the same view, `notarised = some b` (in the
      second branch the premise is unsatisfiable);
    * `vote_step` — transitions are atomic: a single vote transition sends a
      single vote message, so at most one vote per processor per timeslot;
    * `signed_vote` — a correct processor signed `(vote, b)` iff it executed
      the vote transition at some time (links the transcript's signature
      predicate to the state machine). -/

    votes for `b` (§5.1; the `Finset` gives "each signed by a *different*
    processor"). The genesis disjunct of the paper's definition (`b_gen` is
    M/L-notarised by fiat) is omitted at this stage: `Block` is opaque and no
    lemma so far distinguishes `b_gen`; it enters with the ancestry structure
    needed by Lemma 5.4. -/
