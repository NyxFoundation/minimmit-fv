/-- **Lemma 5.7 (Liveness).** Every transaction received by a correct
    processor eventually enters the log of every correct processor.

    Paper proof, mirrored. Suppose correct `p_i` receives `tr` at `t₀`. By
    the round-robin schedule (`hrot`) there is a view `v₁` led by `p_i` with
    `v₁ > curView p_i t₀` and `v₁ > GST`. By Lemma 5.5 some correct processor
    enters `v₁`; since reaching view `v₁` takes at least `v₁ − 1 ≥ GST`
    timeslots, the *first* correct processor to do so does so at
    `t ≥ GST`. Lemma 5.6 then yields a `p_i`-signed view-`v₁` block `b` that
    every correct processor votes for. `ProposeChild` put `tr` into the
    payload of `b` or of one of its ancestors (`propose_includes` — `p_i`
    received `tr` while still in a view `< v₁`). Every correct processor
    eventually holds the `n − f` correct votes for `b` — an L-notarisation —
    and, finalising `b`, adds `tr` to its log (`log_on_lnotar`). -/
